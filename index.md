- Let's you put your problem solving skills and survival skills to the test.
- Use your creativity for everything in the game.
- Great documentation and wiki

You craft items to fight monsters such as swords and bows, pickaxes and shovels to mine minerals and other items such as fences to protect your buildings. Use your pickax or shovel to find minerals underground such as coal, copper ore or iron ore. Then use your coal to turn the iron ore into iron nuggets. Now using your iron you can build some Iron Armour to protect you from mob damage and a Iron Sword to fight the monsters at night, gaining elixir to upgrade your walls that way you are safe from other monster attacks. Any of your other iron nuggets or copper nuggets can them be added to your walls to make them even stronger. 

Enough said here, see more in the [wiki](https://github.com/Derpyface-Development-Co/Craft-Clash/wiki).

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is a fun game that you can play to level up your survival and problem solving skills. You can use this game to practice for when you play Minecraft and as pre-battle practice for battling in Clash of Clans. 

We also created this project to see if two beginner programmers could create a mash up game of the two most popular games for kids right now, in Python which is a language not used (usually!) for games.

## Game Play Instructions
**NOT ALL OF THE BUTTONS WORK RIGHT NOW, WE ARE STILL IN BETA**

After you have opened the app using one of the above options. You will see the apps main welcome interface (GUI/UI). There are three buttons, two of which work right now. The *Play!* button currently does not work but will launch you into your world when it works so you can play the game. Yes, currently there is only one world, because we want to be able to ship new updates faster. Later there will be a screen that lets you choose your world and create new ones.  
The *Options* button will bring you to the options screen which currently only lets you change the volume of the game sounds and the volume of the music. Soon you will be able to change the difficulty, and change your in-game name.

![Options Screen](https://github.com/Derpyface-Development-Co/Craft-Clash/blob/master/doc/optionsscreen.PNG)

The *Exit* button does exactly what it says it does. It exits the game. Due to a minor bug sometimes the game will reopen after you press this button, to fix this just click the red *X* in the top right hand corner. 

To find more information about how to play the game, such as crafting recipes for the world and keyboard controls, see the [wiki](https://github.com/Derpyface-Development-Co/Craft-Clash/wiki).
