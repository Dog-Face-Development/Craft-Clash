PLANNING
========
You can put textures, GUI and music that you have created in the following folders:
- \assets\textures for Textures
- \assets\gui for GUI
- \assets\music for music.
Make sure you are complying with the license for these items.

Current Projects:
-----------------
- Travis CI or Circle CI integration.

Future Projects and Ideas (Anyone is free to contribute here):
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Rather than and inventory / hot bar, maybe more like a deck of cards (Clash Royale ref.). Or when battling a more of Boom Beach interface in which there are cards that you select and attack with.
- Takes time to upgrade walls and defence (2-6 hours, depending on upgrade).
- Could train mobs to become defensive mobs that do your defensive work for you if you convert them with potion, food, etc.
- Mobs:
	- Goats
	- Bears
- Foodstuffs:
	- Apple pie
	- Specific apple trees?
	- Corn
	- Drinks??
