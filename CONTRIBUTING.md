If you are creating a pull request as part of your employment, read the [Entity CLA](https://github.com/Dog-Face-Development/Craft-Clash/blob/master/docs/legal/CLA_ENTITY.md).
- Open a [pull request](https://github.com/Dog-Face-Development/Craft-Clash/compare).
- The CLA Assistant bot will ask you to sign the pull request by writing the following text: `I have read the CLA Document, and I hereby sign the CLA.` If you agree to the CLA, copy the text.

## How to Contribute

### Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Dog-Face-Development/Craft-Clash/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Dog-Face-Development/Craft-Clash/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
- Use the issue templates to create the issue. They include step by step guidelines and have lists of things that should be included.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or updates the documentation?

- Open a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/Dog-Face-Development/Craft-Clash/compare) on GitHub with the patch.
- Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Be sure to include a **title**, and as much relevant information as possible. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

- Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of CraftClash are still accepted! Just follow the same instructions as above.
- However, do ensure that any cosmetic changes follow the Dog Face Development Co. Style Guides, found [below](#style).

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the new feature, [open a new one](https://github.com/Dog-Face-Development/Craft-Clash/issues/new)!

### Do you want to add textures, GUI, or music that you have created to the game?
