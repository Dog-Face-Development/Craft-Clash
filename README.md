A dynamic cross of [Clash of Clans](http://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/) and [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en/). Spend the day upgrading your buildings and walls, craft new items and tend to your world. Have fun spending the night fighting off monsters and hoping you and your world can endure the damage that they do! Written in Python 3 with ❤. Fully open source!! 

**THIS APP IS STILL IN BETA!!**

![Welcome Screen](https://github.com/Derpyface-Development-Co/Craft-Clash/blob/master/doc/mainscreen.PNG)

You can craft items to fight monsters such as swords and bows, pickaxes and shovels to mine minerals and other items and ores to create fences and walls to protect your buildings. Use your pickax or shovel to find minerals underground such as coal and iron ore. Then use your coal to turn the iron ore into iron nuggets. Now using your iron you can build some Iron Armour and a Iron Sword to fight the monsters at night, gaining elixir to upgrade your walls that way you are safe from other monster attacks.
Enough said here, see more in the [game play section](https://github.com/Derpyface-Development-Co/Craft-Clash#game-play-instructions) or the [wiki](https://github.com/Derpyface-Development-Co/Craft-Clash/wiki).

## Game Play Instructions
**NOT ALL OF THE BUTTONS WORK RIGHT NOW, AS WE ARE STILL IN BETA**

After you have opened the app using the above option. You will see the apps main interface (UI). There are three buttons, two of which work right now. The *Play!* button currently does not work but will launch you into your world when it works. Yes there is only one world! We did this that way we could ship our first version of our software faster. The *Options* button will bring you to the options screen which currently lets you change the volume of the game sounds, the volume of the music, edit your in game name, and change your difficulty. The *About* button will bring you to a screen where you can learn more about the game and about its copyright info.
