## Key Features

* Based of modern games.
* A dynamic cross of [Clash of Clans](http://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/) and [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en/).
* One world per install.
* Minecraft like look.
* Includes features from SuperCell games.
* Options screen for customization.
* Cross platform.

> You craft items to fight monsters such as swords and bows, pickaxes and shovels to mine minerals, and other items and ores to create fences
> and walls to protect your buildings. Use your pickax or shovel to find coal and iron ore underground! Then, use your coal to turn the iron
> ore into iron nuggets. Finally, using your iron you can build Iron Armour and a Iron Sword to fight the monsters at night, gaining elixir
> to upgrade your walls, saving you from additional monster attacks.
