pyglet provides an object-oriented programming interface for developing games
and other visually-rich applications for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

Requirements
------------

pyglet runs with Python 2.5+ and also with Python 3 through 2to3 tool (which
is executed automatically when installing). pyglet works on the following
operating systems:

* Windows XP or later
* Mac OS X 10.3 or later
* Linux, with the following libraries (most recent distributions will have
  these in a default installation):
    * OpenGL and GLX
    * GDK 2.0+ or PIL (required for loading images other than PNG and BMP)
    * Pulseaudio or OpenAL (required for playing audio)
    
Installation
------------

If you're reading this README from a source distribution, install pyglet
with:

    python setup.py install

This is required for Python 3 as the code needs to be processed by 2to3  
during the installation.

For Python 2 there are no compilation steps during the installation; if
you prefer, you can simply add this directory to your PYTHONPATH and use
pyglet without installing it.

The documentation is available online at pyglet.org, but if you want to
build the documentation yourself, please check the README file in the doc
directory.

Testing
-------

Because of its interactive nature pyglet uses a custom test runner which is
invoked with:

    % python tests/test.py

The test runner is described in more detail in the tests/test.py docstring.
